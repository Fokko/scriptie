The growth of information in todayâ€™s society is exponential. To process these amounts of data classical approaches are not up to the task instead we need massively parallel software running on tens, hundreds, or even thousands of servers to process the data. This research presents a scalable implementation of the unsupervised Stochastic Outlier Selection algorithm. An outlier is a data points that deviates quantitatively from the majority of the data points and may be the subject of further investigation. The Docker-based microservice architecture allows dynamically scaling according to the current needs. The stack consists of Apache Spark as the computational engine, Apache Kafka as the data store and Apache Zookeeper to ensure high reliability. The distributed implementation showed a quadratic time-complexity as a function of the input-size which is equivalent to the algorithm.
